# Volley
Volley is very similar to pong. The goal is to volley the ball back and forth. There are two rackets. If the ball collides with the border behind one of the racket, a life is lost. For every 3 volleys, a point is scored. The goal is to score the most points before lives run out. Racket one is controlled with 'a' and 'd' while racket 2 is controlled with 'j' and 'l'. 

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and Raylib Python CFFI 3.7 installed and running on your machine. You can install Raylib Python CFFI by opening a terminal and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install raylib
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.```

python3 volley 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the 
project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.
